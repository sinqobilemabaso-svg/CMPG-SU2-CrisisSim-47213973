As Crisis Director for the Executive Communication team, I had to ensure that each micro-unit completed its task while also aligning everything into one coherent executive briefing. Deciding on the correct channel for briefing the CEO was challenging because the situation was urgent, ambiguous, and reputationally sensitive. According to channel richness theory, complex crises require rich communication, but we also needed documented clarity.

The original crisis communication failed because the CIO used a lean channel and ignored audience awareness. The technical email contained jargon and lacked a clear communication function. Although the information was accurate, it was not adapted to the CEO’s background, which delayed executive action.

If this were real, I would immediately brief the CEO by phone and follow up with a structured written summary. A rich channel would reduce ambiguity and enable faster, clearer decision-making.
